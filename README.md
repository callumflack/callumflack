### Hey I'm Callum 👋

I research, design + code beautiful hypertext products that work in the blink of an eye.

Best way to find me is:

Sometimes I write about method:

* [The instantaneous language of beauty](https://www.callum.website/the-instantaneous-language-of-beauty)

Currently mallocing at [Vana](https://github.com/vana-com).
