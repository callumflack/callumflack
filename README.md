### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Callum. I'm a designer who codes with over two decades of experience in design, and over a decade in web engineering. 

Best way to find me is:
* [My website](https://www.callum.website)
* [Txitter](https://twitter.com/callumflack)


<!--
I work best as a bridgehead across design possibilities and the reality of technical implementation.

Recent projects include:
