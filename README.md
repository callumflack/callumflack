### Hi there 👋

I'm Callum. I'm a designer who codes with over 20 years of experience in brand design, interface design and web engineering. I work best as a bridgehead across product design possibilities and the reality of technical implementation.

In the 00s, I was as a brand designer in [London](https://saatchi.co.uk/). Now I work as a frontend engineer at [Vana](https://www.vana.com), an AI start-up in San Francisco. Prior to this, I built [Cleared](https://getcleared.com/) from the initial commit through to its [sale](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/lifemd-acquires-cleared--a1f894e0).

🌞 Recent projects include:

* [Vana Portrait app](https://www.callumflack.design/vana)
* [Studio Round website](https://www.callumflack.design/studio-round)
